# Reconnaissance – Phase 2 (VAPT)

## Overview
This phase focuses on reconnaissance, which is the process of collecting publicly available information about the target without actively exploiting any system. The goal is to identify exposed assets, technologies, and services to understand the attack surface.

## Objective
- Gather Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- Identify domain details, subdomains, and exposed services
- Document findings for further vulnerability assessment

## Tools Used
- WHOIS – Domain registration information
- Sublist3r – Subdomain enumeration
- Shodan – Exposed services and open ports
- Wappalyzer – Technology stack identification
- Maltego – Asset and infrastructure mapping

## Activities Performed
- WHOIS lookup to identify domain ownership and name servers
- Subdomain enumeration to find additional assets
- Technology stack identification to understand backend technologies
- Shodan analysis to detect publicly exposed services
- Asset mapping and logging of findings

## Output
- WHOIS summary
- Subdomain list
- Exposed services log
- Screenshots and evidence

## Result
The reconnaissance phase successfully identified multiple assets and exposed services, increasing the potential attack surface. These findings provide a strong foundation for vulnerability scanning and exploitation in later phases.
