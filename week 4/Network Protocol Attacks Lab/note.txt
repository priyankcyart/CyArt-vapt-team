Responder was successfully deployed on the tun0 interface with LLMNR, NBT-NS,
and HTTP poisoning enabled. The target machine was observed to be vulnerable
to name resolution poisoning; however, automatic NTLM authentication attempts
were not consistently triggered due to lab environment restrictions.
This confirms that in a real-world misconfigured network, NTLM hashes
could be intercepted using Responder.
